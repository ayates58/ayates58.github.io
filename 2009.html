    The Blackhawks would be facing the Eastern Conference champions, Philadelphia Flyers in the Stanley Cup Finals. The Flyers were considered a cinderella team as they were the last team to qualify for the playoffs. As a result, this earned them the  #7 seed in the Eastern Conference. Chicago knew they could not take this team lightly and needed to jump ahead early. The Hawks did exactly that and won the first two games (6-5, 2-1) at home and would now head to Philadelphia for two games. The Flyers would answer in a big way and also win both of their home games 4-3 OT, and 5-3. The series would be tied at 2-2 heading back to Chicago for game five. In Game five, the Blackhawks took an early 3-0 lead and would continue piling on the goals. Philadelphia would respond with 2 goals, but by this time the lead was too big and Chicago won Game 5, 7-4. 
    </p>
    <p class="h"> Game six in Philadelphia was the last opportunity for the Flyers to win the series as they were down 3-2. Chicago scored a goal late in the first period, but Philadelphia would score 30 seconds before the end of the period. In the second period, the Flyers scored 8 minutes into the period only for the Blackhawks to respond with two goals of their own to take a lead of 3-2. This game would eventually head to overtime after the Flyers scored late in the 3rd period. Four minutes into the overtime period Patrick Kane got the puck, shot it, and ran off celebrating. No one could see where the puck was, but Patrick Kane knew he scored and replays confirmed this. Patrick Kane would score the game winning goal and give the Blackhawks their first Stanley Cup Championship since 1961!
