                <p class="h">The 2012-13 regular season was shortened  to 48 games due to a labour dispute between the NHL and the Players' Association. As a  result of this, the Blackhawks would only be able to play conference and divisional games. The Hawks would take advantage of this and ended the regular season with a record of 36-7-5. This record earned the Blackhawks the President's Trophy, which is given to the team who has the best record in the NHL. The Blackhawks would also win the Central Division and earn the #1 seed in the Stanley Cup Playoffs.

                <p class="h"> In the Stanley Cup Finals, the Blackhawks would be facing the Eastern Conference champions, Boston Bruins. The Boston Bruins came into the Playoffs as a #4 seed and would defeat the Eastern Conference #1 seed, Pittsburgh Penguins to make the Stanley Cup Finals.
                </p>
                <p class="h"> Game one started the Finals off in a BIG way. The Boston Bruins were up 3-1 late in the 3rd period before Chicago rallied back with 2 goals in 4 minutes. The game would be tied at the end of regulation and head to overtime. The game would remain tied until the third overtime where Michael Rozsival would score 12:08 into the period to win the game for Chicago. 
                </p>
                <p class="h">Game two would also require overtime as Boston and Chicago each scored one goal in regulation. This time it was Boston who scored a late goal in the overtime period to tie the series at 1-1. 
                </p>

                <p class="h">Overtime was not necessary in game three as Boston's goalie would deny 28 Chicago shots to help Boston win 2-0, giving Boston the series lead 2-1. Not only would game one and two require overtime, but game four would as well. 
                </p>
                <p class="h">
                In game four, Chicago built a 4-2 lead in the 2nd period before Boston would cut the lead down. Boston scored right before the 2nd period ended and minutes after the 3rd period started to tie the game up at 4. The two teams would each score a goal in the 3rd period and end regulation tied at 5-5. At 9:51 of overtime, Brent Seabrook of Chicago  would score a goal to win the game 6-5, and even the series at 2.    

                </p>
                <p class="h"> In game five, Patrick Kane scored two goals (17:27 of 1st period, and 5:13 of the 2nd) to give Chicago  a 2-0 lead. Boston would cut the score to 2-1 in the third period, but Chicago goalie Corey Crawford would deny the tying goal. Chicago would score an empty net goal in the last few seconds to win the game 3-1, and take a series lead 3-2.
                </p>
                <p class="h"> Heading into game six, Boston knew they would have to win this game to stay alive and got out to a 1-0 lead in the first period. The Hawks would answer with a goal of their own in the second period from captain Jonathan Toews. The teams would enter the third period tied 1-1. Boston would score at 12:11 in the third period to take the lead 2-1. With 1:37 left in the game, Chicago would pull their goalie to give them an extra attacker and try to tie the game. This resulted in Bryan Bickell of Chicago scoring a goal at the 18:44 mark to tie the game at 2. With 76 seconds remaining in the period it appeared that this game would be going to overtime, but Chicago had other plans. 17 seconds after Bryan Bickell tied the game, Dave Bolland of Chicago scored a goal that would give the Blackhawks the lead 3-2. This goal would end the game and give Chicago their second championship in four seasons!
