                <p class="h"> The Chicago Blackhawks are a professional hockey team in the National Hockey League (NHL). They are a part of the Central Division in the Western Conference of the NHL. The Blackhawks were established in 1926 with five other teams (Detroit, Montreal, Toronto, Boston, and New York) to create the "Original Six" NHL teams. Owner Frederic McLaughlin named the team the "Black Hawks" after a military unit he was in charge of during World War I. This name would later change to "Blackhawks" in 1986 and will remain this way. In June 1926, McLaughlin bought the team from original owner Huntington Hardwick and owned the team until his death in 1944. Since 1944, the franchise has only had four different owners and is currently owned by Rocky Wirtz.

                <p class="h">The Hawks have played at the United Center in Downtown Chicago, Illinois since 1994. They previously played at the Chicago Stadium from 1929 to 1994, when the stadium was demolished. The United Center can seat up to 19,717 people, but up to 22,428 with standing room. Since 2008, the Hawks have averaged 21,000+ fans at their home games which leads the NHL </p>

                <p class="h"> Since the franchise has been established, they have won six Stanley Cups which is the fourth-most in the NHL. The Stanley Cup is awarded each year to the winner of the National Hockey League Playoffs. Chicago has been awared this trophy in 1934, 1938, 1961, 2010, 2013, and 2015. Winning one Stanley Cup is impressive, but to win three in the past six years is extremely impressive and has been called a dynasty.
